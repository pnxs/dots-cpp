     * @brief Base class for Google Test suites that test components based
     * on DOTS events.
     *
     * Deriving from this class provides Google Test support for components
     * that rely on DOTS events (see dots::Event) via subscriptions or are
     * expected to produce them by publishing instances.
     *
     * Upon construction, the class creates a local DOTS environment,
     * including a DOTS host. Expectations and spoofs of DOTS events can
     * then be created via corresponding test macros (e.g.
     * EXPECT_DOTS_PUBLISH() and SPOOF_DOTS_PUBLISH() respectively).
     *
     * @attention Unless otherwise required, it is recommended to write
     * test cases in the "sequence style" by utilizing the
     * DOTS_EXPECTATION_SEQUENCE() macro.
     *
     * @attention If possible, this class should always be used with the
     * global guest transceiver. This should be sufficient for the majority
     * of use cases, as well as usually result in the most clear and least
     * verbose test cases.
     *
     * @warning This class is intended to be used as a base class only.

         * Calling this constructor from a derived class initializes the DOTS
         * test environment.
         *
         * Similar to an "actual" DOTS application, the test environment is
         * running asynchronously in an event loop. This is because components
         * based on DOTS are inherently asynchronous and also often rely on
         * other asynchronous mechanisms, such as posts or timer events.
         *
         * The event loop defaults to the global event loop, but can be
         * provided by the user if necessary.
         *
         * After the constructor has returned, the test environment will have
         * been initialized and be ready for use.
         *
         * @warning The given IO context must match the IO context used by the
         * components that are part of the test.
         *
         * @remark To reduce clutter in the test output, the constructor sets
         * the logging level to tools::Level::warn. This can be overridden by
         * setting the DOTS_LOG_LEVEL environment variable.

 * @brief Spoof removal of a specific DOTS instance.
 *
 * This function-like macro spoofs (i.e. "injects" or "simulates") that
 * a given DOTS instance is removed by an artificial guest.
 *
 * The resulting remove is for all intents and purposes a "real" remove
 * and will result in corresponding DOTS events for all transceivers
 * that are connected to the host of the dots::testing::EventTestBase.
 *
 * @attention This macro requires usage of the
 * dots::testing::EventTestBase and will not work if the current Google
 * Test suite is not derived from it.
 *
 * @attention The publish is performed asynchronously and will not take
 * place until dots::testing::EventTestBase::processEvents() is called.
 *
 * @remark This macro spoofs instances to be removed. The creation or
 * updating of instances can be spoofed with the SPOOF_DOTS_PUBLISH()
 * macro.
 *
 * @param instance The instance to spoof.
 *
 * @param includedProperties The properties to spoof in addition to the
 * key properties. If no set is given, the valid property set of
 * @p instance will be used.
