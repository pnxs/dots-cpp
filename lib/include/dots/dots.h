 * @brief Global DOTS API.
 *
 * This header provides access to all functions of the global DOTS API.
 * It is intended for simple use cases in which it is not necessary to
 * use specific DOTS transceivers or IO contexts (i.e. event loops).
 * The header is usually used alongside a dots::Application.
 *
 * The interface is similar to that of the GuestTransceiver, but
 * usually results in less verbose implementations, because it avoids
 * having to make a specific transceiver available to all components.
 *
 * However, beware that the global API introduces a global state, which
 * might make it undesirable for more complex applications.
 *
 * To avoid unintentional usage of the global transceiver, the
 * corresponding functions can be hidden by adding the definition
 * DOTS_NO_GLOBAL_TRANSCEIVER to the preprocessor.
